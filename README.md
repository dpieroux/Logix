# Logix

This README files gives a brief overview of the Logix project, together with its
current status.

## Objectives

The objectives of the Logix project are to develop:
1. A proof-checker for propositional logic.
2. An automated theorem proving system for propositional logic;
3. A proof-checker for first-order logic.

The intended audience consists of individuals with an intuitive understanding of
propositional and first-order logic, such as first-year university science or
engineering students, or even high school students specializing in math or
physics.

## Status

The project is currently in its inception phase.

The following decisions have already been made:
* Python has been retained as programming language since it is very popular
  among students and scientists.
* Example will be provided as Jupyterlab notebook.

## Documentation

* [Introduction to the propositional logic](doc/propositional_logic.md)
